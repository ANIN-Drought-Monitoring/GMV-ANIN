## Clone the ANIN-Drought-Indices repository
1. Create a folder where you wish to work, for example "C:\Users\user\Documents\ANIN".
2. Next, open VSCode. In the Welcome tab select "*Open Folder...*" and naviage to the folder you created in Step 1.
3. You should now see a Explorer tab with the folder appearing in it.
4. We recommend installing the VSCode Jupyter exetension. You can access the extensions by going to "*View*>*Extensions*". Then searching in the SearchBar for "*Jupyter*".
5. In VSCode open a Terminal. You can do this by clicking on "*Terminal*>*New Terminal*" on the upper tool bar.
6. Finally, clone the github repository by running the following code in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/ANIN-Drought-Monitoring/GMV-ANIN.git
```

All the files in the ANIN Drought Indices repository will be cloned to your local machine in your specified working folder. You can easily verify that in Windows Explorer, or directly in the Explorer tab in VSCode.

## Create a Virtual Environment with Conda

In Command Prompt, change the directory again to point to the newly created `GMV-ANIN` folder on your PC using the following prompt:
``` 
cd GMV-ANIN
```
Next, create a 'virtual environment' with the necessary libraries for the ANIN-Drought-Monitoring tool. This will help avoid any conflicts with different library versions you may already have in your machine.
You can do this by executing the following command in the terminal:

``` 
conda env create -f GMV-ANIN\environments\SPI-SPEI_environment.yml
```

Once the virtual environment is created, we can activate it.
``` 
conda activate anin
```
!!! tip
    You will need to activate the virtual environment each time you restart your VSCode session. When the virtual environment is activated, you will see (anin) in front of the directory. To deactivate your environment you just need to run:
    ```
    conda deactivate
    ```

Now that all the installations are complete, we can start running the different drought indices tools.
